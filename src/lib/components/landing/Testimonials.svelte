            <p>I created a Float for my Twitch viewers that served as an entry for future giveaways. It was extremely easy to set up and very user friendly for my viewers to collect the Float. For 85-90% of them - it was their first NFT! Floats are great for groups!</p>

            <p>I love the potential that exists with FLOATS - being able to gate exclusive access to something, and for the host to be able to find a way to reward those who attended later on! It paves a way for new possibilities on web3</p>
